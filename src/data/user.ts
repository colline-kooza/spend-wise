  about: `
Hello, World! I am JB (Muke Johnbaptist) — a Fullstack Developer and entrepreneur passionate about building enterprise-level applications and empowering others through programming education.

As the founder of Desishub Technologies, I lead a tech company that builds robust systems and applications. I specialize in Next.js, Node.js, and Hono.js as my core technologies for daily development work.

I'm also the creator behind the JB WEB DEVELOPER YouTube channel, where I share programming tutorials with over 13.3K subscribers. Through my course platform Nextjs Academy, I create clean, job-oriented courses that help developers level up their skills.

As a digital entrepreneur, I've generated over $15K in revenue through online courses and digital products including source codes. I spend most of my time building enterprise-level applications, teaching programming and business concepts, creating educational content, organizing meetups, and running bootcamps.

When I'm not coding or creating content, you'll find me working out, watching netflix or watching football as a passionate Manchester United FC supporter.

Let's connect and build something amazing together!
