# DesiHub Tech Stack 2025: Building a Modern Banking Platform

_Published: November 20, 2025_

---

We're excited to share DesiHub's complete technology stack as we embark on building a robust, scalable banking application designed to serve 5,000+ daily users with millions of requests. This article outlines our architectural decisions, tooling choices, and the reasoning behind them.

## Executive Summary

DesiHub is building a modern banking platform with microservices architecture, focusing on security, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. Our stack leverages battle-tested open-source technologies combined with strategic paid services where they provide clear value.

**Target Metrics:**

- 5,000+ daily active users
- Millions of API requests per day
- 99.9% uptime SLA
- Sub-200ms API response times
- Bank-grade security and compliance

## Our Technology Decisions

### Backend Architecture: Go + Microservices

We chose **Golang** as our primary backend language for several critical reasons:

**Why Go?**

- **Performance**: Near C++ speeds with garbage collection
- **Concurrency**: Native goroutines handle thousands of concurrent requests efficiently
- **Memory footprint**: Significantly lower than Java or Node.js
- **Deployment**: Single binary deployment simplifies operations
- **Banking industry adoption**: Used by Monzo, Nubank, and American Express

**Core Backend Stack:**

```
Framework:      Gin (HTTP routing & middleware)
ORM:            GORM (PostgreSQL interactions)
Auth:           golang-jwt/jwt + go-guardian
Authorization:  Casbin (RBAC engine)
Validation:     go-playground/validator
```

**Why Gin over alternatives?**
Gin provides the perfect balance of performance (40x faster than Martini) and developer experience. It's production-proven at companies like Xiaomi and Tencent.

### Frontend: Next.js 14+ with App Router

**Frontend Stack:**

```
Framework:        Next.js 14 (React Server Components)
State Management: Simple Store + TanStack Query (React Query)
Styling:          Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui
Forms:            React Hook Form + Zod validation
Authentication:   NextAuth.js
```

**Why This Combination?**

**Next.js** gives us:

- Server-side rendering for better SEO and initial load times
- API routes for backend-for-frontend (BFF) pattern
- Automatic code splitting and optimization
- Built-in image optimization

**TanStack Query** eliminates complex state management for server data:

- Automatic caching and background refetching
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Reduced boilerplate compared to Redux/Redux-Saga

**Shadcn/ui** provides:

- Copy-paste components (you own the code)
- Built on Radix UI primitives (accessibility built-in)
- Fully customizable with Tailwind

### Database Architecture

**Primary Database: PostgreSQL 16**

PostgreSQL is our single source of truth. Why PostgreSQL?

- **ACID compliance**: Critical for financial transactions
- **JSON support**: Flexible schema where needed
- **Performance**: Excellent query optimization
- **Reliability**: 20+ years of production hardening
- **Cost**: Open source with commercial support available

**Configuration Strategy:**

- Master-replica setup for read scaling
- Connection pooling via pgBouncer
- Partitioning for large tables (transactions, audit logs)

**Caching Layer: Redis**

Redis handles:

- Session storage
- API response caching
- Rate limiting counters
- Real-time leaderboards/analytics
- Pub/Sub for real-time notifications

**Alternative Considered: MongoDB**  
We chose PostgreSQL over MongoDB because:

- Financial data needs strong consistency
- ACID transactions are non-negotiable
- PostgreSQL's JSON support gives us flexibility where needed
- Lower operational complexity (one database to master)

### Message Queue: RabbitMQ

For asynchronous processing and microservice communication:

**Use Cases:**

- Email/SMS notifications
- Transaction processing pipelines
- Audit log generation
- Report generation
- Webhook dispatching

**Why RabbitMQ over Kafka?**

- Lower operational overhead
- Better for traditional queuing patterns
- Sufficient throughput for our scale (5K users/day)
- We'll migrate to Kafka if we exceed 100K+ messages/second

### Payment Integration

**Primary Gateway: Stripe**

- Industry-leading developer experience
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Strong fraud protection
- PCI compliance handled
- Cost: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction

**Regional Alternatives:**

- **Paystack**: African markets (1.5% + ₦100 local cards)
- **Flutterwave**: Multi-gateway redundancy

We're implementing a payment gateway abstraction layer to support multiple providers and easy switching.

### Microservices Architecture

Our services are organized by domain:

```
├── auth-service          (Authentication & JWT)
├── user-service          (User management & KYC)
├── account-service       (Bank accounts & balances)
├── transaction-service   (Payments & transfers)
├── notification-service  (Email, SMS, Push)
├── audit-service         (Logging & compliance)
├── analytics-service     (Reporting & insights)
└── api-gateway          (Routing & rate limiting)
```

**Communication Patterns:**

- Synchronous: REST APIs (Gin HTTP)
- Asynchronous: RabbitMQ (event-driven)
- Real-time: WebSockets for notifications

### Infrastructure & Hosting

**Hosting Provider: Hetzner Cloud**

After evaluating AWS, DigitalOcean, Linode, and Hetzner, we chose Hetzner for:

- **Price-performance ratio**: 40-60% cheaper than AWS/DO
- **Included traffic**: 20TB/month vs 1-2TB on competitors
- **European data centers**: GDPR compliance by default
- **Predictable pricing**: No surprise egress fees

**Phase 1 Infrastructure (MVP):**

```
Production Environment:
├── 3x App Servers     (4 vCPU, 8GB RAM each)  - €46.20/month
├── 1x Database        (8 vCPU, 16GB RAM)      - €36.26/month
├── 1x Cache/Queue     (4 vCPU, 8GB RAM)       - €15.40/month
├── 1x Monitoring      (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM)       - €4.15/month
└── Load Balancer      (Nginx on separate VPS)  - €4.15/month
Total: ~€110/month (~$120/month)
```

**Staging Environment:**

- 1x All-in-one VPS (4 vCPU, 8GB RAM) - €15.40/month

**CDN & Security: Cloudflare**

- Free tier for MVP (DDoS protection, CDN, SSL)
- Pro plan ($20/month) when we need WAF and image optimization
- R2 storage for file uploads (free egress = massive savings)

### DevOps & CI/CD

**Version Control: GitHub**

- Private repositories for all code
- Branch protection rules
- Required PR reviews (2+ approvers for production)

**CI/CD: GitHub Actions**

Our pipeline:

```yaml
Pipeline Stages:

### Testing Strategy

**Testing Pyramid:**

```
                    ╱╲
                   ╱  ╲
                  ╱ E2E ╲         ~10% (Critical flows)
                 ╱────────╲
                ╱          ╲
               ╱ Integration╲     ~30% (API contracts)
              ╱──────────────╲
             ╱                ╲
            ╱   Unit Tests     ╲   ~60% (Business logic)
           ╱────────────────────╲
```

**Backend Testing:**

- **Unit tests**: `testify` package (80%+ coverage target)
- **Integration tests**: Testcontainers (real DB/Redis)
- **Load testing**: k6 (simulate 10K concurrent users)

**Frontend Testing:**

- **Unit tests**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **E2E tests**: Playwright (critical user journeys)
- **Visual regression**: Percy or Chromatic

**Performance Testing:**

```bash
# k6 load test example
k6 run --vus 1000 --duration 5m load-test.js
```

We test for:

- 1,000 concurrent users baseline
- 5,000 concurrent users peak
- 10,000 concurrent users stress test

### File Storage Strategy

**Cloudflare R2** (S3-compatible)
