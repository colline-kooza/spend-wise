# A Builder's Mindset: Key Insights from My Recent Talk with Emerging Developers

Yesterday, I had the incredible privilege of being hosted by the Kanzu Code Foundation for an online session themed "A Builder's Mindset: Grow Your Skillset Through Real-World Projects." As the main speaker, I found myself face-to-face with passionate beginner and junior developers who had prepared some truly thought-provoking questions that many in our industry are grappling with today.

The energy in that virtual room was palpable – these developers weren't just looking for quick answers; they were seeking genuine guidance on navigating the rapidly evolving tech landscape. Their questions revealed the core concerns that keep emerging developers awake at night, and I'm excited to share some of the insights we explored together.

## The Burning Questions That Define Our Times

The participants came prepared with questions that struck at the heart of modern software development:

- **AI and the Future of Coding**: "With LLMs that can write code and seemingly do everything, is there even a need to learn how to code?"
- **Standing Out in a Saturated Market**: "Most projects we're building already exist – how do we stand out in the crowd?"
- **The Learning Path Dilemma**: "What should I learn first, and how do I monetize my skills?"

These aren't just beginner concerns – they reflect fundamental shifts happening across our entire industry.

## AI is Like a Calculator: A Tool, Not a Replacement

One of the most powerful analogies I shared was comparing AI to the calculator. When calculators were first invented, many people feared that mathematicians would become obsolete. Sound familiar?

Instead, what happened was revolutionary in a different way. The calculator became an invaluable tool that freed mathematicians to tackle bigger, more complex problems while the machine handled routine computations. But here's the crucial part: we don't give calculators to children learning basic arithmetic. Why? Because they need to build their mathematical intuition, understand the fundamentals, and learn how numbers actually work.

The same principle applies to AI in software development. For beginners who haven't yet mastered the fundamentals, AI can become a crutch that prevents genuine learning. **If you don't understand the code AI writes for you, don't use it.** The moment AI is doing something you don't comprehend, you're essentially training it to replace you rather than assist you.

Senior developers, on the other hand, can leverage AI effectively because they have the foundational knowledge to:

- Evaluate AI-generated code critically
- Debug issues when they arise
- Understand the implications of different approaches
- Know when to trust AI and when to question it

### How Beginners Should Actually Use AI

Instead of asking AI to "do it for me," try these approaches:

- **Career Planning**: Share a job description with AI and ask for a learning roadmap
- **Concept Learning**: Ask AI to explain concepts, not to implement solutions
- **Code Review**: Use AI to explain existing code you're trying to understand
- **Problem-Solving Guidance**: Ask for approaches and methodologies, not complete solutions

## Building Projects is Like Learning to Drive

Here's another analogy that resonated strongly with the audience. When you attend driving school, they give you theoretical knowledge and some practical experience. But no employer would hire you as a driver based solely on that certificate, right?

The real confidence comes when you get your own car and start using it daily – driving to work, taking friends around, handling unexpected situations. Each journey builds your confidence and demonstrates your actual capability.

Software projects work the same way. You need to build real applications that solve actual problems. But here's where many beginners go wrong: they get overwhelmed thinking about massive, groundbreaking projects.

### Start Where You Are

Instead of chasing the next unicorn startup idea, look at your own life:

- Build a personal notes app that works exactly how you want it
- Create a simple online shop for a friend's business
- Develop tools for communities you're part of

I've practiced what I preach here. I built an app for our men's guild group at church to register members and record meetings. I created a savings app for our fitness group. I'm currently working on a church management system. These aren't revolutionary ideas, but they solve real problems for real people, and that's what builds both skills and confidence.

### Build in Public

Don't hide your projects until they're "perfect." Build in public because:

- You get immediate feedback from real users
- People can hold you accountable to your commitments
- You create a portfolio that speaks louder than any resume
- You connect with like-minded developers and potential mentors

## Focus on Problems, Not Programming Languages

One of the most liberating insights I shared was about the language obsession that plagues many beginners. When a client wants an online shop, they won't specify whether to use Python, JavaScript, or PHP. They want their problem solved.

Programming languages are like smartphones. When someone asks you to call them back, they don't specify whether to use an iPhone or Samsung – they just want the communication to happen.

I see too many beginners constantly switching languages instead of mastering one well enough to build complex applications. Pick a language that aligns with your goals, get good at it, and start solving problems. Depth beats breadth every time when you're starting out.

## The Power of Mentorship and Community

Throughout the session, I emphasized something that no tutorial or documentation can replace: the value of having mentors and being part of a supportive community. Having someone who can guide you, hold you accountable, and provide perspective when things get tough is invaluable.

This is exactly why I founded Desishub Technologies – not just to build software, but to mentor the next generation of developers. The technical skills are just part of the equation; the mindset, problem-solving approach, and confidence-building are equally crucial.

## A Personal Thank You

I want to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the Kanzu Code Foundation and Roland for hosting this session. The opportunity to share insights with such an engaged and thoughtful group of developers was incredibly energizing. The quality of questions and the genuine enthusiasm for learning reminded me why I'm passionate about mentoring in the first place.

## Your Journey Starts Now

To every developer reading this – whether you attended the session or not – remember that your journey is unique. Don't let the noise about AI, market saturation, or technology trends discourage you from building. The world needs problem-solvers, and every expert was once a beginner.

Start building. Start sharing. Start solving problems, even small ones. The confidence and skills will follow.

The future belongs to builders who can think critically, solve problems creatively, and use every tool available – including AI – to create value for real people facing real challenges.
